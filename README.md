# MLH Orientation Hackathon - Time Scheduling App ⏰

## Project Description

Time Scheduling App is a React App, meant to help students in the MLH Fellowship find a better way of working across the world, and in different time zones than their fellow students. It helps students find what hours of their working day, overlap with their teammates in order to facilitate synchronous work.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your computer. ✔️
2. CD into `mlh-orientation-hackathon`. ✔️
3. CD into `time-app`. ✔️
4. Run `npm install` to install all modules listed on the `package.json` file and their dependencies. ✔️
5. Create a `.env` file. In the `.env` file, paste this code `REACT_APP_API_KEY=FAJIO7OXE21N`. ✔️

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token). Allow the `repo` scope for proper access. Paste `GH_TOKEN=<the personal access token generated>` into the `.env` file. ✔️
